# Face Recognition using OpenCV and Haar Cascade

![Face Recognition Demo](demo.gif)

## Overview

This project implements a robust Face Recognition system using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, and Haar Cascade classifiers. The system is capable of detecting and recognizing faces in images or live video feeds, making it suitable for various applications such as security, surveillance, access control, and more.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces in images or video streams.
- **Face Recognition**: Matches detected faces with known faces stored in a database to recognize individuals.
- **Real-time Processing**: Performs face recognition in real-time, enabling seamless integration into applications requiring live face recognition.
